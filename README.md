Global Cyber Ladies

What is the “Cyber Ladies” movement?
It’s a movement to get accomplished women in cybersecurity together at meetups, to give talks and speak up about their work, get comfortable with public speaking and network with other such amazing ladies in a comfortable, professional, and friendly environment (and no “product pitch” talks ). These were our values from the first event. 90% of our meetups so far have featured mostly female (or female-identifying) for both speakers and attendance, but this isn’t a must and is up to each event organizer to decide per event, in the spirit of their own communities. 


Communications: Originally, most of our communications took place via emails, and we also have a LinkedIn Group and Facebook groups for the Israeli meetup - which is called “Leading Cyber Ladies”:  https://www.linkedin.com/groups/3682063/

New for 2018, we have a global presence with a twitter account, https://twitter.com/cyber_ladies and hashtag:  #cyberladies  and  Meetup account (thanks to Tanya & Microsoft for sponsoring ) : check out

Finally: That’s it  from me, I wish to see many more global cyber ladies events pop up and hopefully we can get more women in our industry to prosper, thrive and lead the change towards equality  we would all like to see in our society!
