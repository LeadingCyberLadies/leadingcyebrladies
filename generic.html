							<h2>What is the “Cyber Ladies” movement?</h2>
							<p>The year is 2015</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>It’s a movement to get accomplished women in cybersecurity together at meetups, to give talks and speak up about their work, get comfortable with public speaking and network with other such amazing ladies in a comfortable, professional, and friendly environment (and no “product pitch” talks ). These were our values from the first event. 90% of our meetups so far have featured mostly female (or female-identifying) for both speakers and attendance, but this isn’t a must and is up to each event organizer to decide per event, in the spirit of their own communities.</p>

							<p>History: The first ever “Leading Cyber Ladies” meetup took place in Israel, January 2015. The meetup was originally the idea of Hila Meller, who was an executive with CA Europe at the time - she is now the amazing head of security for BT in Europe! Hila suggested the idea of the meetup to me and together we planned and hosted the first-ever meetup for women in cyber security in Israel – the speakers were some amazing ladies like EL AL Israeli Airlines ’s CISO, and the leading digital crimes prosecutor in Israel, among others. Here is the cool picture taken at the first ever meeting: Hila Meller is the tall blonde in the blue shirt and jacket (4th from the right), and Keren Elazari is the brunette and red leaning in the front. We originally called ourselves the “Leading Cyber Ladies” - using this ‘brand’ and logo is up to each chapter , but we liked it in Israel since it represented our trailblazing and pioneering values.</p>

							<p>Some Facts and Figures: Since 2015, Cyber Ladies meetups took place quarterly or every few months, in Israel, hosted by companies like: CA, Akamai, Check Point, Palo Alto Networks, Gartner Israel , Bank HaPoalim (the biggest bank in Israel) and we also partnered with local organizations like Tel Aviv University , Israel’s National CERT, OWASP Israel chapter and “She Codes” to host several events.
							All of our meetups featured talks by amazing speakers from within our community, speaking about their professional expertise - whether it’s using DNS to uncover evasive attacks, or describing new breakthroughs in encryption technology, and reverse engineering minesweeper – just to give you a few examples. We also included content about how to get the most value from attending security conferences, or VC analyst reviews about the state of the cyber security startup industry in Israel – so you can see the content is very broad and each meetup had a variety of topics presented. We usually had between 3-5 speakers per event, and between 20 and 50 participants. In 2017, we started inviting younger “aspiring” cyber ladies to join our meetups. We also had a couple of more casual, happy hour even without a ton of content, just as a fun networking event.</p>

							<p>Who are the organizing Ladies?</p>

							<p>Since our first meetup in 2015, K3r3n3 has pretty much lead and organized most of the 2015-2016 events with some local help, as Hila in based in Europe and has other commitments. In 2017, Keren asked Reut Menashe and Shira Shamban who were speakers in 2016 and 2017 cyber ladies events, to join as co organizers.</p>
